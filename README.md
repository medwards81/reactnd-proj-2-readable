# Readable Project

This is the second project for the React Nanodegree from Udacity. It is a single page app emulating the popular reddit comment app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This project depends on an extenal api server to feed content.  Please follow the directions below for installing and launching both applications.

## TL;DR

### 1. Install and launch the api server:

* download or fork and clone the [starter server repository](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter)
* install the project dependencies with `npm install`
* run the server with `node server`

### 2. Launch the Readable app:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser
